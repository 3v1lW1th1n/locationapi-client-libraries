/**
 * You can send 1 to 7 cell ID objects. If your device supports scanning for more than 7 cell objects, reach out to us and we’ll increase this limit on your account. The first cell object has to be that of the serving cell, i.e. the tower the device is connected to. The others are neighbouring cell objects that are visible to the device. Except lac and cid all other parameters mentioned below are optional. Parameters vary depending on the radio type. Supported radio types and their corresponding parameters are
 * @param lac the Location Area Code of your operator’s network.
 * @param cid Cell ID
 * @param radio 
 * @param mcc \"Mobile Country Code of your operator’s network represented by an integer (Optional). Range: 0 to 999.\"
 * @param mnc Mobile Network Code of your operator’s network represented by an integer (Optional). Range: 0 to 999. On CDMA, provide the System ID or SID, with range: 1 to 32767.
 * @param signal Signal Strength (RSSI)
 * @param psc Primary Scrambling Code
 * @param asu Arbitrary Strength Unit
 * @param ta Timing Advance
