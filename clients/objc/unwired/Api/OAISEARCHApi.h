/// Forward Geocoding
/// The Search API allows converting addresses, such as a street address, into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). These coordinates can serve various use-cases, from placing markers on a map to helping algorithms determine nearby bus stops. This process is also known as Forward Geocoding.
///
/// @param q Address to geocode
/// @param viewbox The preferred area to find search results.  To restrict results to those within the viewbox, use along with the bounded option. Tuple of 4 floats. Any two corner points of the box - &#x60;max_lon,max_lat,min_lon,min_lat&#x60; or &#x60;min_lon,min_lat,max_lon,max_lat&#x60; - are accepted in any order as long as they span a real box.  (optional)
/// @param limit Limit the number of returned results. Default is 10. (optional) (default to @10)
/// @param acceptLanguage Preferred language order for showing search results, overrides the value specified in the Accept-Language HTTP header. Defaults to en. To use native language for the response when available, use accept-language&#x3D;native (optional)
/// @param countrycodes Limit search to a list of countries. (optional)
